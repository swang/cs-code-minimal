# What is this?
This merely contains a snippet of CoffeeScript code to generate all possible CoffeeScript tokens in the smallest set of code possible.

# What counts as an improvement?
Reduction in total tokens required to generate all the tokens.

# Bro, do you even compile?
Yes, this compiles as proper CoffeeScript, but that doesn't necessarily mean anything.
